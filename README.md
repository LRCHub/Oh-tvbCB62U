```lrc
[00:21.69] Of all the things you wished you'd never done
[00:26.70] I've heard you say that this is number one
[00:31.90] Another life down another road
[00:36.95] Perhaps you're better off to never know
[00:42.24] Don't dream of all the ways things could've been
[00:47.34] Remember all the faces you let in
[00:52.46] Remember all the faces still unseen
[00:57.70] Soon enough, you'll see just what I mean
[01:02.00] There's nothing to cry about
[01:06.58] 'Cause baby, baby, you're out
[01:20.33] You've always felt it's hard to voice complaints
[01:26.04] But what you voice is what will drive your fate
[01:31.17] And old things never really got that bad
[01:36.37] Dreams of greener grass'll drive you mad
[01:41.61] Don't dream of all the ways things could've been
[01:46.68] Remember all the faces you let in
[01:51.87] Remember all the faces still unseen
[01:56.97] And soon enough, you'll see just what I mean
[02:01.38] There's nothing to cry about
[02:05.79] 'Cause baby, baby, you're out
[02:12.86] Baby, you're out
[02:18.48] Baby, you're out
[02:23.62] Baby, you're out
